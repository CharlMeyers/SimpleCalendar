# SimpleCalendar
A simple calendar that can replace your printed out version on the wall.

This calendar has been made to be as simple as possible, with no extra fluff. It is intended to replace any printed out calendars on your walls. Making it perfect for Andruino and Rasberry Pi projects, or anything similar. Colors are kept to a minimum to try make this look as good as possible on e-paper displays.

Since this is intended to run fromm limited hardware there are as little included libraries as possible. SO far the only included library is [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) added through a CDN.

To use it go to [simplecalendar.online](www.simplecalendar.online), or run `index.html` directly on your hardware.
